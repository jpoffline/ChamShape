ChamShape: To do
-------------------

> PROBLEM
- convergence
> RESOLUTION
- now using SoR: equations solved to within 10^-10 accuracy (integrated)
- SoR only uses 2nd order accurate finite difference derivatives

> PROBLEM
- find screened solution
> RESOLUTION
- not sure yet

> PROBLEM
- find optiumum box size
> RESOLUTION
- not found yet (needs extensive testing)

EXTENSIONS
- 3D: cartoon method: axially symmetric sources only
- 3D: general shapes
- 2&3D: simulated annealing to find optimum shapes
